# Hello-world
First project Aug 2017
My name is Jason and this will be my very first project. I'm not quite sure what it's going to entail, but It should at the very least be interesting. Hopefully I'll grasp this quickly. 
So I did the first tutorial and I'm feeling ok about it. Not great but ok. Next I'll be trying to add things to practice a little bit. :smile: :wink::bowtie:
